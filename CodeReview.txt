1. XML documentation comment is not accurate and informative.
   a) Method name is GetRowEx and not GetRowsEx!
   b) There is a grammatical error. It should be 'the difference is' and not 'the different is'.
   c) <see cref="" /> tag can be used to link to GetRows method
   d) <param/> tag should be used to describe input parameters
   e) <returns/> tag should describe return parameter

2. Method name, GetRowEx, is not descriptive.

3. Parameters order should be (DbCommand command, string sql, DbCommon db, DbType[] types, object[] values, bool noDateTime)

4. SRP violation
   a) This method can be executed by passing in just sql or sql with types & values. So, we should split it into 2 separate overloaded methods as follows:
      public static object[] GetRowEx(DbCommand command, string sql, bool noDateTime)
      public static object[] GetRowEx(DbCommand command, string sql, DbCommon db, DbType[] types, object[] values, bool noDateTime)

5. Boolean parameter, noDateTime, leads to 2 different flows. Each of above methods can be split further as follows:
   public static object[] GetRowWithDateTime(DbCommand command, string sql)
   public static object[] GetRowWithNoDateTime(DbCommand command, string sql)
   public static object[] GetRowWithDateTime(DbCommand command, string sql, DbCommon db, DbType[] types, object[] values)
   public static object[] GetRowWithNoDateTime(DbCommand command, string sql, DbCommon db, DbType[] types, object[] values)

6. Line 10 - Other parameters are not logged. 

7. Parameter, db, is needed only when types and values are passed.

8. Line 22 - local variable rd can be descriptive such as reader.

9. Line 31 - we should use {} for if statement even if there is only 1 enclosing statement.

10. Line 31 - we can capture, row[i] as datetime, within the if statement's condition itself. With this, we can get rid of explicit cast.

11. Line 39 - Other parameters are not logged. StackTrace should be logged for better diagnostics. Method name is GetRowEx and not GetRowsEx. 
   This hardcoding can be removed by using nameof().

12. Line 12, 22, 25, 28, 31, 33, 42 - Line-break is missing.
